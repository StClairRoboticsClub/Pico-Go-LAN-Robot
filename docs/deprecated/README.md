# Deprecated Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that have been **superseded** by the unified `/init.md` context file.

These files are kept for **historical reference only** and may contain outdated information.

## Consolidated Files

The following files have been merged into `/init.md`:

- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** → Merged into init.md sections 1-3 (Project Snapshot, Tech Stack, Architecture)
- **QUICK_SUMMARY.md** → Merged into init.md section 1 (Project Snapshot) and section 6 (Quick Start)
- **ACTION_PLAN.md** → Obsolete (LCD integration completed)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** → Obsolete (project is operational)
- **oringinal_project_specs.md** → Historical reference (see EngineeringReference_v2.md for detailed spec)
- **LCD_WORKING.md** → Superseded by docs/LCD_GUIDE.md

## Why These Were Deprecated

1. **Duplication**: Multiple files describing the same setup steps
2. **Outdated**: Action plans and status docs for completed work
3. **Inconsistency**: Conflicting information across documents
4. **Fragmentation**: Information scattered instead of unified

## Current Documentation Structure

For all current documentation, refer to:

- **`/init.md`** — Unified context file (2,900+ words)
- **`docs/QUICKSTART.md`** — 5-minute setup guide
- **`docs/HARDWARE.md`** — Hardware assembly and wiring
- **`docs/NETWORKING.md`** — Network setup and diagnostics
- **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** — Problem-solving guide
- **`docs/LCD_GUIDE.md`** — Display states and usage

## Migration Date

Documentation consolidation completed: **2025-11-06**

**Note**: If you're reading this directory, you probably want `/init.md` or one of the docs listed above instead!
