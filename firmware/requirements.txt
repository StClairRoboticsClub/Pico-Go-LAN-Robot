# MicroPython Dependencies for Pico-Go LAN Robot Firmware
# Raspberry Pi Pico W with MicroPython 1.22+

# Installation instructions:
# Connect Pico W via USB, then:
#   mpremote mip install <package>

# Core built-in libraries (no installation needed):
# - uasyncio (async/await support)
# - network (Wi-Fi connectivity)
# - machine (GPIO, PWM, SPI)
# - json (JSON parsing)
# - time (timing functions)

# Optional external libraries:

# WebSocket support (if using WebSocket instead of TCP)
# mpremote mip install uwebsocket

# ST7789 LCD driver (may be pre-installed on Waveshare board)
# mpremote mip install st7789

# Note: Most functionality uses built-in MicroPython libraries.
# The firmware is designed to work without external dependencies.
